# ðŸš¨ Vercel Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
**Error**: "Deploying Serverless Functions to multiple regions is restricted to the Pro and Enterprise plans"

**Cause**: Your `vercel.json` file has multiple regions configured, but you're on the free Hobby plan.

## IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Remove Multi-Region Configuration
We need to update your `vercel.json` to use only one region for the Hobby plan.

### Step 2: Updated Configuration
The current `vercel.json` has:
```json
"regions": ["bom1", "sin1"]
```

For Hobby plan, we need to use only one region or remove it entirely.

### Step 3: Quick Fix Options

**Option A: Use Single Region (Recommended)**
- Keep only `"bom1"` (Mumbai) for Indian users
- Remove `"sin1"` (Singapore)

**Option B: Remove Regions Entirely**
- Let Vercel auto-select the best region
- Remove the entire `regions` configuration

## SOLUTION STEPS

1. **Update vercel.json** (I'll do this for you)
2. **Push changes to GitHub**
3. **Try creating Vercel project again**
4. **Should work without errors**

## Alternative: Upgrade Vercel Plan
If you need multi-region deployment:
- Upgrade to Vercel Pro plan ($20/month)
- Keeps current configuration
- Better performance globally

## Expected Result
After fixing the configuration:
- âœ… New Vercel project creation will work
- âœ… Deployment will succeed
- âœ… App will show â‚¹999 pricing
- âœ… All features will work
