# 🚨 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Problem Confirmed
- ✅ Local code shows ₹999 (correct)
- ❌ Live site shows ₹1,999 (old version)
- ❌ Vercel is not deploying latest GitHub changes

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Force Redeploy in Vercel (FASTEST)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click "..." → "Redeploy"
5. Select "Use existing Build Cache: NO"
6. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Fix GitHub Integration (PERMANENT)
1. **In GitHub Repository Settings:**
   - Go to https://github.com/sivahari1/FlipBook-DRM/settings
   - Click "Webhooks" → Delete any AWS Amplify webhooks
   - Click "Applications" → Remove AWS Amplify access

2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Project Settings → Git
   - If disconnected, click "Connect Git Repository"
   - Select: sivahari1/FlipBook-DRM
   - Branch: main

### Option 3: Manual Trigger (IMMEDIATE)
Run this to trigger a new deployment:

```bash
# Make a small change and push
echo "# Deployment trigger $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force deployment trigger - Fix pricing display"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
After any of these fixes:
- ✅ Live site shows ₹999 (1 Month Plan)
- ✅ All other recent changes appear
- ✅ Future pushes auto-deploy

## Verification
Check your live site: https://flip-book-drm.vercel.app
- Pricing section should show ₹999 for 1 Month Plan
- If still ₹1,999, the deployment didn't work

## Root Cause
Your GitHub repository is connected to AWS Amplify instead of Vercel, so Vercel doesn't receive webhook notifications when you push code.
